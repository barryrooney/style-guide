========================

After struggling with build for my first version I am wiping the slate clean and trying to build a second version with:

Simplified Overall Design, Navigation and reduced elements

Refined colour scheme to use #00ffbb which renders better on all broswers.

Refined H1-H4 and use of Raleway font as I cant afford the Futura webfont atm.
